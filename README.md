# gtk-rs tests [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gtk-rs/tests.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gtk-rs/tests) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/pi27a5xubp0ihl2d?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/GuillaumeGomez/tests)

A few gtk-rs tests (and can be used as examples). To build, just do:

```Shell
> cargo build
```

or to enable GTK 3.10 examples as well:

```Shell
> cargo build --features gtk_3_10
```

And then run the executables. Please be sure to have installed all the required libraries before building tests (the list is available on [gtk](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk/).
